# Atlas v1

> **Status: draft.** Not a source of truth until it is marked `active`.
> Where it disagrees with `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/spec.md` or
> `design/README.md`, those win, and the disagreement belongs under Open
> threads.

## Why this exists

The owner works across a browser, an IDE (PyCharm), a notes app and their own
business software, Fledge. Each holds part of the context, and none can
search the others. Atlas puts all four in one window: a browser first, with
code, notes and Fledge as built-in plugins that open as tabs, and one command
palette and one search over everything (`docs/spec.md`, "What this is").

The spec's phased plan (`docs/spec.md`, "Phased plan") and the research in
`docs/research/` are done; there is no code yet. This plan turns them into
work that can be built, in order, starting with the engine decision that the
owner reopened on 2026-10-09 (`docs/decisions.md`).

If nothing is done, the research goes stale. It is dated 2026-10-09 and
tracks fast-moving projects (Tauri's unstable multi-webview, GPUI snapshot
releases, the WebView2 Evergreen runtime).

## The idea, as first described

The braindump is the "Brief" section of `docs/next-session-prompt.md` as
committed in `e5ecfaf` (2026-10-09). It is kept there rather than copied here,
because it is long; that commit is the unchanged original. In short:

- **Atlas** is a browser-first workspace: a desktop browser with a
  vertical-tab sidebar, where Forge (code), Notes and Fledge run as built-in
  plugins that open as tabs, with one command palette and one search.
- **Performance decides.** Low memory per tab, fast start, low typing and
  scrolling latency, low idle CPU. TypeScript and Svelte are allowed; all
  state and logic stay in Rust.
- **The first decision is the engine and UI:** A, GPUI chrome plus the system
  web view (recommended by research note 06); B, Tauri 2 with a Svelte chrome
  (the spec's plan, 06's fallback); C, Chromium through CEF (a contingency);
  D, Servo (not ready). Settle it with the owner, then confirm it with a spike.
- **Phase 0 is a gate:** Google sign-in first, then 15 daily sites, memory,
  start-up and latency against Edge and a control build, both overlay
  approaches, and shortcuts while a page has focus. It ends with a per-OS
  verdict and a go/no-go against thresholds the owner confirms.
- **v1 (proposed)** is Atlas as the owner's daily browser on Windows with spec
  sections 1–4 and the Must items of `docs/research/02-browser-v1-scope.md`,
  split into four plans: (1) engine, browser core and palette; (2) plugin
  runtime and Fledge; (3) Notes; (4) Forge. Outline all four; build the first.
- **Work the research says must be planned:** native shortcut routing, a
  permission handler from day one, the plumbing the engine lacks, memory
  levers, privacy defaults, the two-tier search, and the Fledge-side gaps
  (which are a list for the owner, not issues in Fledge's repositories).

## Our understanding (2026-10-09)

**What the owner said:**
- The outcome is one app that replaces a separate browser, IDE and notes app
  for the owner, with one search and one source of context (`docs/spec.md`).
- It is a browser first. The default experience on launch is browsing.
- Performance is the deciding goal (`docs/decisions.md`).
- Standing decisions are listed under "Decisions taken" and are not reopened.

**What this plan assumes, until the owner confirms (⚠️):**
- ⚠️ The only user for v1 is the owner, on their Windows 11 machine (build
  26300). Open source comes later.
- ⚠️ Success means Atlas is the owner's default browser for daily use, with
  memory and start-up close to Edge's.
- ⚠️ The work is done by the owner with Claude Code agents; there is no team.
- ⚠️ The 15 sites in `docs/research/06-engine-and-ui-performance.md` (Phase 0
  checklist, item 4) are the owner's real daily set.

**Facts the owner gave (2026-10-09):**
- They stay signed into Google every day as part of their normal workflow
  (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, YouTube). Google sign-in is therefore a must, not a
  nice-to-have.
- They watch YouTube, and sometimes Disney+ and Hulu, in the browser.
- They have no Mac.

**Size:** this is four plans sharing one braindump, as the brief proposes.
The split is confirmed at step 4, after research.

## What we found

Research notes 01 to 06 in `docs/research/` cover the engine, browser scope,
Tauri and wry facts, import and signing, the core architecture, Forge and
Notes, the Fledge API and performance. The findings that shape this plan are
filled in after the first question rounds and the gap research (step 3).

## Is it realistic?

To be written after research. See Open threads.

## Decisions taken

Standing decisions, recorded so they are not re-litigated:

| # | Decision | Chosen | Source | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Profiles or modes | One workspace; no profiles or work/dev modes | `docs/spec.md`, "Decisions already made" | 2026-10-09 |
| S2 | Engine | Embed an existing engine; never build one | `docs/spec.md`; `docs/decisions.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S3 | Where state and logic live | Rust owns all state and logic; the UI layer is thin | `docs/spec.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S4 | Graph view | Excluded | `docs/spec.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S5 | Command palette | Central | `docs/spec.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S6 | Deciding goal for engine and UI | Performance | `docs/decisions.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S7 | Import | A CSV file only | `docs/decisions.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S8 | Signing, SmartScreen, Microsoft Store | Deferred until productisation | `docs/decisions.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S9 | Distribution | Probably open source, released on GitHub | `docs/decisions.md` | 2026-10-09 |
| S10 | Design | Every decision in `design/README.md` stands; changing one needs the owner's yes | `design/README.md` | 2026-10-09 |

Known limits, stated rather than hidden: no Chrome extensions; no password
manager and no ad blocking in v1.

Decisions made in this plan:

| # | Decision | Chosen | Rejected, and why | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D3 | Which engine renders pages in v1? | The system WebView2 (Edge's Chromium, part of Windows), driven from Rust; everything Atlas draws and decides stays Rust. Servo is added later as a per-tab engine once it handles the owner's sites, re-checked about every six months | Servo only: fails Google sign-in, YouTube, Drive and GitHub, has no DRM, downloads, PDF or printing, and runs unsandboxed by default (`docs/research/06-engine-and-ui-performance.md`, "Short answer"). Servo and WebView2 per tab from v1: two engines' plumbing for one developer. CEF: still embedded Chromium for Google, no Widevine without a Google licence, hundreds of MB and a release every 4–8 weeks. A Firefox (Gecko) fork like Zen: no desktop embedding API, so a full fork rebased every Firefox release; the owner dropped it | 2026-10-09 |
| D2 | Which platforms does v1 run on? | Windows 11 only. macOS is neither built nor tested in v1 (the owner has no Mac and doesn't want Mac testing). ⚠️ Linux is assumed out too: the owner didn't name it, and wry's Linux child web views are X11-only (`docs/research/06-engine-and-ui-performance.md`, "Defer") | macOS in v1: no machine to test on, and it needs far more built (find, downloads, certificate warnings, mute; `docs/research/02-browser-v1-scope.md`). Linux in v1: it would make CEF the plan there | 2026-10-09 |
| D1 | May the plan be committed while it is being planned? (`CLAUDE.md` says commits only when the owner asks) | Yes: commit as we go, to the local branch `claude/plan-atlas-v1`; no pushes, since there is no remote | Leaving the plan uncommitted until the end: a compaction or a closed session would lose the only record of the decisions | 2026-10-09 |

## What exists today

No code. The repository holds the spec, the owner's decisions, the design
snapshot (`design/canvas/project/`, palette tokens in the `tokens()` method of
`design/canvas/project/Main.dc.html`), the original mockup
(`design/reference/unified-workspace-mockup.html`) and research notes 01–06.
The repository is local, with no remote.

## Open threads

The minimum list from the brief, grouped. Each is cleared as it is answered.

- **Platforms and engine:** how the chrome is drawn (GPUI or Tauri + Svelte);
  what to do if
  Google blocks sign-in in WebView2 (research 07 running); whether Disney+ and
  Hulu play in WebView2 (research 07 running); spike thresholds and the frozen
  page under the palette; a patched fork of wry or tao.
- **Browser behaviour:** pinning shortcut (Ctrl S or Ctrl Alt S); default
  search engine and live suggestions; WebView2's own password saving; the
  Passwords button; what the CSV import holds and from which tool.
- **Data and search:** third-party plugins ever; indexing page text; Fledge
  data copied or searched live; synced data folder; one store or two; snapshot
  retention.
- **Forge:** git CLI for writes; requiring Git for Windows; language servers
  installed only, downloads later or never; debugger out of v1; run control and
  Python task runners.
- **Notes:** Obsidian compatibility; native or web-view editor; IME scripts.
- **Fledge:** third-party OAuth client; REST or MCP; drafts never sent; where a
  lead's Company lives; when Stage C happens.
- **The project:** licence; GitHub account or organisation, and visibility.

## Iteration log

- **2026-10-09** — Engine settled (D3). The owner first asked about a Firefox
  fork like Zen, then about a Rust engine with no reliance on another app.
  Servo was laid out against the owner's needs (Google daily, YouTube,
  Disney+, Hulu) and fails both hard requirements today, so the owner chose
  WebView2 now and Servo later as a per-tab engine. The Firefox-fork research
  was stopped unfinished at the owner's word; no note was written.
- **2026-10-09** — Round 1 answers: v1 is Windows only, with no macOS work or
  testing (D2). The owner uses Google daily and streams YouTube, Disney+ and
  Hulu; a researcher was sent to check Google sign-in and DRM in WebView2
  as of today (`docs/research/07-google-sign-in-and-drm.md`). Q1 (engine and
  UI) and Q5 (realism and the four-plan split) are still open.
- **2026-10-09** — Plan file created from the brief in
  `docs/next-session-prompt.md`. Research notes 01–06 read (summaries,
  recommendations and owner questions). First question round sent (engine
  and UI, platforms, Google sign-in, DRM, realism and the four-plan split,
  committing). The owner allowed committing as we go (D1); the rest of the
  round is open.
